# SDUCloud Frontend

SDUCloud uses a web application as frontend for its users.

This repository contains the frontend components used in SDUCloud, logic for contacting backend services and a test suite.

## Code Structure

Of notable npm-packages, the frontend uses the `React`-frameworks, along with the `Redux` library for handling data<sup>\*</sup>, and the `Styled-Components` library for styling of components. Addtionally, the application uses the `React-Router` for navigation, `jest` for testing. The project is written in `TypeScript`.

Each category (category meaning e.g. Files, Applications, Dashboard, Activity), groups components by their association, i.e. every component referring to a category, will be found in the corresponding folder. Additionally, if a component has a reducer, it will be placed in a folder named `Redux`, along with the associated reducer actions, using the naming convention `<ComponentName>Reducer` and `<ComponentName>Actions`

Data is retrieved from the backend by contacting the corresponding backend-services in charge of the data.

<sup>\*</sup> Some components use local state, if the contents are obsolete the moment the component is unmounted, e.g. forms.

## Application Architecture

**Figure**: The application will on startup instantiate the Redux-store, which is then used for every connected component. Every component, that does not solely rely on local state, connects to the store and gets its state from there. When a component is mounted, updated or a user interaction happens, the current component can contact the backend using the CloudObject instance. When the backend responds with data, an action is created and sent to the reducer. A new state is then derived, and sent to the component, providing the component with its new state.

## Running

To run the project run the following commands, in the directory `./webclient/`:

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

When the terminal outputs `Compiled successfully.`, the project is available at `http://localhost:9000/app`.

`npm install` will only be necessary to run on subsequent runs, if the package.json file has been updated since the last
time.

## Additional npm Commands

Additional npm commands are:

- `npm run clean` will delete the contents of the `./webclient/dist/` (if present).
- `npm run prepare-icons` will generate React components for icons defined in `./webclient/app/ui-components/components/`

## Testing

The front-end contains a test suite, implemented using Jest.

To run the test suite, use the command: `npm run test`.

The test files is located in the [tests](./webclient/__tests__/) folder.

## Security

Logging in to the site is done through Wayf on the production version, or with username/password combination on the development version, both as described in [auth-service](../auth-service#authenticating-with-sducloud).

The [SDUCloud object](#sducloud-object) will validate the every new JWT-token received from the backend when refreshing. This is done throught the structure of the JWT, not the actual contents of the JWT.

On invalid token, the site will redirect to the login screen.

On token expiration, the frontend will try to refresh the token. Failing that, the currently held tokens are cleared, and the user is redirected to the login page.

### Roles

A logged in user can either be a `USER` or an `ADMIN`. The `USER` role only has access to a subset of the available sidebar options that the `ADMIN` role has, e.g. User Creation.

## Notable custom code

### SDUCloud object

The project utilizes JSON Web Tokens, which contain information regarding the (if any) currently logged in user.

To abstract away from this when contacting the backend, the codebase includes the `SDUCloud`-object, that has an instance exported for use, which contains the relevant HTTP operations (e.g. GET, PUT, POST, DELETE).

This means contacting a Files-service with a `get`-operation would be done as shown below:

```typescript
try {
    const { request, response } = Cloud.get<File[]>("files-service/operation");
} catch (e) {
    /* Error handling */
}
```

Here, the request in the deconstruction of the object is the XMLHttpRequest made, and response is the result, which must match the type defined in the generic (defaults to `any`).

The `e` in the event of a failing promise, matches the structure of `{ request, response }` but lacks type safety.

Calls made to the backend are prefixed with `api/` followed by the service called, followed by the operation.
