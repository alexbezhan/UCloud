# File Sensitivity

All files in UCloud have an associated sensitivity level. Sensitivity
levels is an indicator for the user who is working with the file.
This allows users to, at a glance, know if the files they are working with
are sensitive or not. It also allows the internal systems of UCloud to make
decisions based on the sensitivity level of a file.

The table below summarizes the different sensitivity level:

| Sensitivity Level | Description                                                                                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inherited         | This file inherits its sensitivity level from its parent                                                   |
| Private           | The file contains no sensitive or confidential data. It can only be read by those it has been shared with. |
| Confidential      | The file contains confidential data. However, it contains no personal information.                         |
| Sensitive         | The file contains sensitive personal data.                                                                 |

The "inherited" sensitivity level is the default sensitivity level. In this
mode a file will inherit its sensitivity level from its parent. This
definition is recursive. This means that if a file's parent is also
inheriting then the file will inherit from its grandparent. The home
directory of users and projects cannot have a sensitivity level of inherit.
As a result all files will eventually have a concrete sensitivity level.
