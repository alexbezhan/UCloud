# Downtime management service

A service for managing downtimes planned for the UCloud system.

Admins can add a time range, along with text to describe why the downtime will happen, available in the admin dashboard.
This view also allows for removing specific downtimes and removing expired downtimes.

Upcoming downtimes will be shown for every user in the header, and can click on the icon to see a detailed description
of the closest upcoming downtime.

The status site is not connected to the service and will need to be managed separately.
