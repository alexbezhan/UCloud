description: >
  RapidNJ is an algorithmic engineered implementation of canonical
  neighbour-joining. It uses an efficient search heuristic to speed-up the
  core computations of the neighbour-joining method that enables RapidNJ to
  outperform other state-of-the-art neighbour-joining implementations

      The program can usually guess the input format, otherwise this option
      can be used to choose between different formats. To infer a tree from
      an alignment in Stockholm format use 'sth'.
